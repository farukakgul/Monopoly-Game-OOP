The winner of the game will either be the only person who is not bankrupt or will be the person with the most money. &#10; &#10;Preparation &#10;Each player selects a token. Then they place their token on the board near the space labelled Go, placing it on Go only when their first turn to move arrives. Only the player in question can use their money, money can only be lent by the player money. Each player is given ₩1,500 in cash divided as follows: two each of ₩500s, ₩100s and ₩50s; six ₩20s, five each of ₩10s, ₩5s and ₩1s. All remaining cash and other equipment go to the Bank. They must collect ₩200 when they pass GO. &#10; &#10;General &#10; &#10;Using Dice: On a player's turn, the player must roll the dice and move his/her token forward the number of spaces as rolled on the dice. Players can do any trades, building improvements etc. at the start of their turn before rolling the dice. &#10;Unowned Property: If the player lands on an unowned property, the player may buy it for the price listed on that property's space. If he or she agrees to buy it, he or she pays the Bank the amount shown on the property space and receives the deed for that property. If he or she refuses to buy the property for the amount stated on the deed, the turn moves to the consecutive player. &#10;Unmortgaged Property: If the player lands on an unmortgaged property owned by another player, he or she pays rent to that person, as specified on the property's deed. It is the property owner's responsibility to demand rent, and he or she has until the beginning of the consecutive following player's turn to do so. &#10;Mortgaged Property: If the player lands on his or her own property, or on property which is owned by another player but currently mortgaged, nothing happens. &#10;Luxury/Super Tax: If the player lands on Luxury Tax/Super Tax, he or she must pay the Bank ₩100. &#10;Income Tax: If the player lands on Income Tax he or she must pay the Bank ₩200. &#10; &#10;If the player lands on a Chance or Community Chest, the player takes a card from the top of the respective pack and performs the instruction given on the card. &#10;Jail Visit: If the player lands on the Jail space, he or she is Just Visiting. No penalty applies. &#10;Go to Jail: If the player lands on the Go to Jail square, he or she must move his token directly to Jail. &#10;Passing GO: If the player lands on or passes Go in the course of his or her turn, he or she receives ₩200 from the Bank. A player has until the beginning of his or her next turn to collect this money. &#10;Selling Houses and Deeds: You may sell houses back to the Bank for half the purchase price or sell property deeds to other players in the game. &#10;No Loans: Players may not loan money to other players. Only the Bank can loan money, and only through mortgaging properties. &#10; &#10;Doubles &#10; &#10;Doubles: When doubles are rolled, the player resolves the roll as normal (including purchase, renting or passing GO), but must roll the dice again for another turn. The player again moves forward as directed by the dice, and if this is also doubles, rolls again. &#10;Three Consecutive Doubles: If the third dice roll is doubles, the player is instead moved directly to jail. The sole exception is rolling doubles to exit jail, which doesn't allow for an additional turn. &#10; &#10;Jail &#10; &#10;Go To Jail by Location, Card or Dice: When landing on the square marked Go to Jail, drawing a card marked Go to Jail, or rolling three consecutive doubles when moving in a turn, the player is placed directly in the jail cell, and does not get any benefit for passing GO. &#10;When in Jail: Players in jail may collect rent on other players that come their property. However, they cannot buy or sell any properties while they are in jail. &#10;Get Out of Jail Free Card: When in jail, a player may use a get out of jail free card, owned via picking , or pay the ₩50 fine or skips one turn. Otherwise, the player can attempt to escape jail by trying to roll doubles - if successful, the player moves the number of squares but doesn't get the extra turn. If the player fails to roll doubles for three turns, he or she must pay the ₩50 fine and then moves the number shown on the dice or skip one turn. &#10; &#10;Properties, Rents, and Construction &#10; &#10;Buying a Property: If a player lands on property he/she may buy it at the listed price. If the player refuses to buy it, then the turn moves on to the next player. Properties are arranged in color groups of two or three properties. &#10;Monopoly: Once a player owns all properties of a colour group (a monopoly), the rent is now doubled on all unimproved lots of that color group, even if any of the properties are mortgaged to the bank or if other properties in the group have houses. &#10;Purchasing Buildings: The player may purchase up to four houses or one hotel per property (and only if there are properties to hold the houses), which raise the rents that must be paid when other players land on the property. &#10;Rules for Construction 1: If a player wishes to buy a house/hotel for a property, they must wait for their turn. The player does not need to be on the property they wish to put the house/hotel on. &#10;Rules for Construction 2: The properties in a color group must be developed evenly, i.e. each house that is built must go on a property in the group with the fewest number of houses on it so far. &#10;Rules for Construction 3: A hotel may be built on a color group only after all properties in the group have four houses. A player purchases a hotel by paying the price of an additional house, and returning the four houses on that property to the Bank in exchange for a hotel. &#10;Mortgaging: Also, properties with no houses or hotels may be mortgaged for half of the property price. A property does not collect rent while mortgaged and may not be developed. To de-mortgage a property a player must pay a mortgage price. Whenever a mortgaged property changes hands between players, either through a trade, sale or by bankruptcy, the new owner must immediately pay only the mortgaged value. &#10; &#10;Railroads &#10;The rent a player charges for landing on a railroad varies with the number of railroads that are also owned by a player. The rent is as follows: Charge ₩25 if one is owned, ₩50 if two are owned, ₩100 if three are owned, ₩200 if all four are owned. &#10; &#10;Community Chest &#10; &#10;Cards &#10; &#10;Advance to Go.

Collect $100. &#10; &#10;Property &#10; &#10;In the game of Monopoly, the winning objective is to bankrupt all opponents. Properties are necessary to achieve this goal. Properties may be bought in one of 3 ways: landing on the property space and buying it, being the highest bidder in an auction for property, or buy it from an opponent in a trade. Properties may also be received from bankrupted players, provided the Bank didn't bankrupt them. &#10;When a player buys or otherwise gains possession of a property, he or she receives the property's corresponding title deed, which lists all relevant information on the property. &#10;When a player owns all the properties in a color group (or 2/3 to 3/4 in the mega version), she or he is said to have a monopoly, which allows the player to charge double rent or build it up with Houses and Hotels. &#10;The properties in Monopoly standard editions are named after streets in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and though a few are no longer around, many still exist, and are just as famous in the town as they are in the game. &#10;Property costs and rents escalate as the player rounds the board. Properties range anywhere from $60 to $400, while rents can range from $2 to $2000! For more information, see each individual property by selecting its name below: &#10; &#10;İstanbul &#10;Ankara &#10;İzmir &#10;Bursa &#10;Antalya &#10;Adana &#10;Konya &#10;Şanlıurfa &#10;Gaziantep &#10;Kocaeli &#10;Mersin &#10;Diyarbakır &#10;Hatay &#10;Manisa &#10;Kayseri &#10; &#10;Tokens &#10; &#10;Tokens are the playing pieces used in the Monopoly board game. They differ depending on the edition and the year of release of an edition. Standard editions, however different they are, usually use pewter tokens. In 1998, a new piece was voted on to be added to the existing 10 ( 11 in gold sets) The winner was a sack of money, which appeared in most standard editions until it's retirement in 2007. &#10; &#10;Houses &#10; &#10;Types &#10;There are houses and hotels. In the original game, houses were small green buildings and hotels were larger red buildings. In different variations not only the properties and tokens change, but so do the houses. &#10; &#10;Cost &#10; &#10;The cost for a house differs from each property. These are the prices in the original game for 1 house: &#10; &#10;Browns\Purples and Light Blues- £\$50 &#10;Pinks and Oranges- £\$100 &#10;Reds and Yellows- £\$150 &#10;Greens and Dark blues- £\$200 &#10; &#10;A hotel costs the same as a house but 4 houses are needed to build a hotel. &#10;Houses can only be bought when all of the spaces in the monopoly are owned by the same player. Even build is a rule, that is, you cannot have a hotel on one property and have 2 houses on the others. The only time this can happen is if the 2 properties are not the same monopoly. There is a thirty-two house limit. However, a common house rule is to have infinite houses. &#10;You can NOT build on railway roads or build on mortgaged properties. You can NOT build at all if one property in the set is mortgaged. &#10;For example, it costs £\$2000 to build hotels on both Dark Blue properties (Park Lane\Park Place and Mayfair\Boardwalk) &#10; &#10;Purpose &#10; &#10;The purpose of houses and hotels is to increase the rent of a property. This is the most evident and easiest way to win Monopoly (be the richest player). The more houses, the higher the rent rises. For example, if someone has built hotels on Mayfair\Boardwalk and you land on it, you must pay that person £\$2000. This normally results in bankruptcy but not all the time. &#10; &#10;Selling Houses/Hotels &#10; &#10;If you owe someone money and you can not raise it by mortgaging and handing over cash, you can sell your houses and/or hotels. This does result in losing profit as you can sell houses/hotels for only half their original cost. &#10; &#10;For example, it costs: &#10;Browns\Purples and Light Blues- £\$25 &#10;Pinks and Oranges- £\$50 &#10;Reds and Yellows- £\$75 &#10;Greens and Dark Blues £\$100 &#10; &#10;No property can be sold or traded with buildings on it; these must be sold back to The Bank for half of what it cost to erect them. &#10; &#10;Hotels &#10; &#10;Hotels are buildings that give the property the most cash possible for the player. The hotels cost the same as the houses, only you give up the houses for it. They command better rents, If a player lands on the hotel and they don't own it, they could pay from $250 on Mediterranean Avenue to $2000 on Boardwalk if a hotel is on them. On the higher cost hotels such as Ventnor Avenue or Illinois Avenue, they could easily bankrupt players from not enough assets to pay for them. &#10;Before a property can be mortgaged or traded, any buildings on it must be sold back to The Bank for one half of the cost to erect it. &#10; &#10;Dice &#10; &#10;Dice are six-sided cubes that have numbers 1 to 6 on each side. &#10; &#10;Board &#10; &#10;Includes the properties and cards. Tokens move on it. &#10; &#10;Blitz Mode: &#10; &#10;In this mode, the game must be able to do the following: &#10;Initialize each player with some limited amount of time at the start of the game &#10;Display the remaining times of each player at any given time &#10;Decrease the remaining time of the current player &#10;Remove the player from the game if his time runs out &#10; &#10;Reverse Mode: &#10; &#10;In this mode, the board must have Reverse locations in place of the Community Chest locations. Like any other location, the current player must be able to land on a Reverse. After the player lands on a Reverse, the game must be able to do the following: Reverse the direction flow of the game, which means that all of the tokens will move in the negative direction.
