Basic Features:
In Monopoly players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. The game has numerous house rules, and hundreds of different editions exist, as well as many spin-offs and related media. 

Extra Features:
Number of players can be selected between 3 and 6.
Bid: If a person goes bankrupt, her possession will be sold to other players on the offer basis. (players who bid the highest price for a property will have it).
Trading: either properties or money can be exchanged for other properties ( e.g. 120,000 + Property_1 traded with Property_13 + Propoerty_14)
One of the extra modes added to the game is that the rents can be doubled to finish the game in a short time for games that exceed a certain time.
Multiple game modes such as Blitz, Classic, Reverse, Police.*
Map Editor: Users can customize the given maps or even build their maps. They will be able to change property names, property fees, property rents and many other things. 
Parking Mafia: If a player lands on the free car park slot and receives the money in the middle, when the player lands on someone else’s property he or she will have to pay ¼ of the received money in addition to the rent of the property.

Design Purposes:
The game screen basically consists of a board placed in the middle, pawns moving on it, dice thrown by the players on the board, and the players' money around the board. In addition to these, there is also a leaderboard that is constantly updated according to the remaining money of the players.
Pawns and dice will have nice movement animations. 
Occupied properties will take the player’s color. So it will be easier to determine which player has which property.
We will add background music and buttons to adjust the music level.

* Game Modes:
Blitz: In this game mode, we adopt a similar approach to the Monopoly game same as the Fast Chess (Blitz). All four to six players (up to change) will have a timer set at the specified value at the start of the game. At each round, the passed time is subtracted from the current player’s timer. When the time is up for a certain player, the player cannot throw any more dice and cannot take any action at all. When all of the timers are up or a person wins the game, the game ends.
Classic: This game mode plays the same as the classic Monopoly.
Reverse: In this game, all of the public fund slots are turned into reverse slots. When a player gets to any reverse slot, the game flow turns from clockwise to counterclockwise or vice versa.
Police: In this mode, one slot will be reserved for a police station. If a player arrives at the police station, the player may spawn a police officer by paying a little amount of money. The police officer travels through the board at the end of every tour. If the officer encounters a player, the police penalties the player, and the player has to pay a specific amount of money to the police officer.
Tax (Liberal’s Nightmare): In this game mode, each player pays their taxes, some percentage of their net worth, each time they pass the start.
Quarantine: Instead of entering jail, you enter quarantine due to COVID-19 either by dice or by chance cards. When you enter quarantine, you have to place some amount (will be decided) of your money in the middle. As you do in the classic version, you will have to wait for 3 turns if you are not able to roll a double. You will also have to pay some money when you exit in your final turn.
